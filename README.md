### `Quiz App for Tandem Apprenticeship`

Here you will find a lovely little app built with React and their Hooks!

To start it up locally, you should clone the repo down and then in the terminal of your preferred editor, usher the classic commands into the void as follows: 

`npm install` and

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


`Note`

There is a chance the `app.css` is not capitalized in the import statement in `App.js`. If that is the case, kindly capitalize both the file in the tree and import statements. A fix has been pushed to solve this issue.

There is a branch, `useQuery`, that I am using to play around with frontend caching. It is not a part of my official submission to Tandem and should be disregarded unless you are interested in some random useQuery junk.
